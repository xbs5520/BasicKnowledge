# TCP/IP

## Concept

### OSI vs TCP/IP model

OSI: 7 layers (Physical → Application)

![image-20250921081103120](Protocol/image-20250921081103120.png)

TCP/IP: 4 layers (Link, Internet, Transport, Application)

![image-20250921081206512](Protocol/image-20250921081206512.png)

### **IP**

Best-effort delivery, no guarantee of order/reliability.

```shell
#check networks interfaces and IPs
ip addr
#or
ifconfig
```

### **TCP**

Reliable, connection-oriented, ordered.

```shell
#TCP connections
netstat -tulnp | head
#or ss(Socket Statistics)
ss -tulnp | head
```

### **UDP**

Unreliable, connectionless, fast.

```shell
#use TCP and UDP set a connection
#TCP
nc -l 12345
#other terminal
nc 127.0.0.1 12345
```

use `lsof ` to check port. They are established.

![image-20250921084323263](Protocol/image-20250921084323263.png)

```shell
#UDP
nc -u -l 12346
#other terminal
nc -u 127.0.0.1 12346
```

not established.

### **Ports**

Identify which process gets the data.

### **Encapsulation**

Data → Segment (TCP/UDP) → Packet (IP) → Frame (Ethernet).

## Q&A

### Why does TCP need a 3-way handshake instead of just 2?

Establish

![image-20250921085148679](Protocol/image-20250921085148679.png)

Close

![image-20250921085215916](Protocol/image-20250921085215916.png)

if just 2 way(SYN --> SYN-ACK), the server need allocate resources immediately after SYN-ACK.

But if client's SYN was a delayed/duplicated packet(from old connection). Then the resources are wasted.

The **third ACK from the client** proves that:

1. The client actually exists and is ready.
2. Synchronized `/ˈsɪŋ.krə.naɪzd/` : Both sides can reach each other in both directions.

### When choose UDP?

**Low latency, no overhead** → e.g. gaming, VoIP, video streaming.

**Application-level control** → you don’t want retransmissions or flow control (e.g. DNS queries, where retry logic is simpler at app layer).

**Broadcast/multicast support** → UDP can send to many receivers efficiently; TCP is point-to-point only.

UDP is chosen when speed and simplicity are more important than reliability.

### How does encapsulation help when designing modular networks?

Encapsulation makes networks modular, flexible, and scalable.

Encapsulation = each layer **wraps its data** with headers and passes it down:

- **Application → Transport → Network → Link → Physical**

- Example: An HTTP request (Application) gets encapsulated in TCP segments (Transport), then in IP packets (Network), then in Ethernet frames (Link).

Benefits:

1. **Separation of concerns** – each layer only needs to know how to talk to the layer directly above/below it, not the whole stack.
2. **Flexibility** – you can swap IP (IPv4 → IPv6), or swap Ethernet with Wi-Fi, without changing the application.
3. **Interoperability** – vendors can implement parts independently, as long as they respect interfaces.

# TCP

## Features

**Reliability Mechanisms**

- **Sequence numbers** → ensure ordered delivery and detect duplicates.
- **Acknowledgments (ACKs)** → receiver confirms what it has received.
- **Retransmission (RTO, fast retransmit)** → if ACK not received, resend.

**Flow Control (Receiver-Side)**

- Sliding window (advertised `rwnd`) → prevents sender from overwhelming receiver.
- Window size advertised in TCP header → sender must respect it.

*What happens if the receiver advertises window size = 0?* 

Sender pauses sending until receiver updates it.

**Congestion Control (Network-Side)**

- Classic algorithms: **Slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, fast recovery**.
- Goal: avoid congestive collapse of the Internet.
- Modern algorithms: **CUBIC, BBR**.

*Why does TCP start slow?* 

To probe available bandwidth without flooding.

**Connection Management**

- **Establishment** → 3-way handshake.
- **Teardown** → FIN → ACK → FIN → ACK (4-way close).
- **TIME_WAIT state** → prevents confusion from delayed packets.

**Other Features**

- **Nagle’s Algorithm** (reduce small packets; interacts badly with `delayed ACK`).
- **Delayed ACKs** (receiver waits briefly to ACK in case it can piggyback).
- **Keepalives** (to detect dead peers).
- **Out-of-order delivery handling**.

## Q&A

### Why does TCP need both flow and congestion control?

**Flow control** → protects the **receiver**. -- congestion window (cwnd)

**Congestion control** → protects the **network**.  

### What is fast retransmit vs timeout retransmit?

**Timeout retransmit**:

- Sender waits until **RTO (Retransmission Timeout)** expires.
- Only then resends the packet.
- Problem → slow recovery when a packet is lost.

**Fast retransmit**:

- Triggered by **3 duplicate ACKs** (receiver keeps ACKing the last in-order packet).
- Sender infers that a segment was lost (but later packets arrived).
- Retransmits **immediately**, without waiting for RTO.

Fast retransmit is quicker and avoids waiting for timeout; timeout retransmit is the fallback when ACKs don’t arrive at all.

### Why is TCP fair between flows?

- Congestion control algorithms

  - Each flow slowly increases cwnd (additive increase).

  - When loss occurs, all affected flows reduce cwnd (multiplicative decrease).

- Over time → multiple flows sharing a link tend to get a roughly equal share of bandwidth.

TCP fairness comes from the fact that all flows back off when there’s congestion, so no single flow hogs the link forever.

*TCP achieves reliability and fairness with a mix of flow control (receiver safety), congestion control (network safety), and retransmission strategies (fast recovery). That’s why TCP flows usually share bandwidth fairly.*

# UDP & QUIC

## UDP

**Connectionless**: No handshake, just fire-and-forget.

**Unreliable**: No guarantees of delivery, order, or duplication.

**Lightweight**: Small header (8 bytes).

Used in: DNS, VoIP, video streaming, online games.

*Why use UDP when TCP is reliable?*

**Lower latency** → no 3-way handshake.

**Custom reliability** → app can add its own retransmission (like QUIC, RTP).

**Broadcast/multicast support**.

## QUIC

Runs **on top of UDP** (user-space protocol).

Designed by Google, now IETF standard.

Key features:

1. **Built-in TLS 1.3 encryption** (no need for separate TLS handshake).
2. **Multiplexed streams** → avoid TCP *head-of-line blocking*.
3. **Faster connection setup** → 1-RTT, sometimes 0-RTT.
4. **Better mobility** → connection survives IP change (Wi-Fi ↔ 4G).

*Why QUIC over TCP+TLS+HTTP/2?*

QUIC integrates transport + crypto + multiplexing → lower latency and better resilience.



**HTTP/1.0 & 1.1** → over **TCP**

**HTTP/2** → over **TCP** (with TLS usually)

**HTTP/3** → over **QUIC** (and QUIC itself runs over **UDP**)

# IP & Routing

## concept

### **IP basic**

- IP = Internet Protocol, provides **logical addressing** and **best-effort delivery**.
- Two versions: 
  - **IPv4 (32-bit addresses)**   
    -  (~4.3 billion) dotted decimal (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
  - **IPv6 (128-bit addresses)**.
    - (~3.4×10^38), hexadecimal, separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8::1`).

### **Subnetting**

Divides a network into smaller **sub-networks**.

Helps:

1. Efficient IP use.
2. Localizes traffic → reduces broadcast domains.

Example: `192.168.1.0/24` → 256 addresses; `/26` → 64 addresses per subnet.

### **Routing Tables**

- Routers use them to decide **where to forward packets**.
- Each entry = `(destination network, subnet mask, next hop, interface)`.
- **Longest prefix match** is used to pick the most specific route.
- Default route (`0.0.0.0/0`) → is used when no specific route exists.

### **NAT**

NAT = **Network Address Translation**

- Maps **private IPs** to **public IP** for Internet access.
- Types: static, dynamic, PAT (overload).
- Solves **IPv4 address shortage**, but breaks end-to-end connectivity.

### **ICMP **

ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol

- Used for **network diagnostics and error messages**.
- Examples:
  - `ping` → Echo Request / Reply.
  - `traceroute` → Time Exceeded messages.
- **doesn’t care data transfer**; just for control/infomation.

### ARP 

ARP = **Address Resolution Protocol**

- Maps **IP addresses → MAC addresses** in a LAN.
- Example: if `192.168.1.100` wants to send a packet, it asks “Who has this IP?” → gets MAC → can send Ethernet frame.
- IPv6 uses **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)** instead of ARP.

### **Routing**

- Routers forward packets based on **destination IP**.
- Uses **routing tables** and algorithms (RIP, OSPF, BGP).
- Packet forwarding = **longest prefix match**.

### **Fragmentation**

- If a packet is bigger than the link MTU(Max trans Unit), IPv4 may fragment it.
- IPv6 avoids this by requiring end-hosts to handle MTU discovery.

## Q&A

### Why do we need **logical IP addresses** instead of just MAC addresses?

**MAC address**: tied to the hardware,works only in the **local network (LAN)**. typically used by Switches.

**Problem**: MACs don’t provide hierarchical addressing. You can’t scale them for the entrie internet.

**IP address**: logical, hierarchical (network + host). Makes routing scalable, because routers only need prefixes(e.g. `192.168.0.0/16`).

Without IP, the global internet routing would be impossible.

### What happens if a router doesn’t know the route to a destination?

Router checks its **routing table**

If no entry →

- If there’s a **default route (0.0.0.0/0)**, it forwards the packet there.
- If no default → router **drops the packet** and usually sends back an **ICMP “Destination Unreachable”** message.

### Compare **IPv4 with NAT** vs **IPv6 with global addressing**: which do you think is better for scalability?

**IPv4 + NAT**:

- Pros: solves address exhaustion, lets many devices share one public IP.
- Cons: breaks end-to-end connectivity, complicates peer-to-peer, VoIP, some protocols need NAT traversal (STUN, TURN, etc.).

**IPv6 global addressing**:

- Pros: each device gets a unique address, restores clean end-to-end model, simplifies routing.
- Cons: deployment is still slower, many networks still rely on IPv4.

**For scalability**: **IPv6 is better** (huge address space, no NAT hacks).
 But in practice, IPv4 + NAT is still dominant due to compatibility.

# HTTP/HTTPS & APP Layer

## Concept

### **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**

- Protocol for **request/response communication** between client (browser) and server.
- **Stateless**: each request is independent.
- Common methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`.

### **HTTPS**

- HTTP over **TLS/SSL** → encrypts communication. (Use TLS handshake) 	`curl -v https://example.com`
- Prevents eavesdropping, tampering, and impersonation.
- Port 443 (HTTPS) vs port 80 (HTTP).

### **Application Layer**

- Top layer in the TCP/IP model.
- Responsible for **network services** like:
  - Web (HTTP/HTTPS)
  - Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
  - File transfer (FTP, SFTP)
  - DNS (domain name resolution)
- Provides **interfaces for user applications** to communicate over network.

### **Request/Response Flow**

- Client sends **HTTP request** → Server processes → Sends **HTTP response**.
- Response contains **status code**, headers, and optional body.
- Example: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, `Content-Type: text/html`, body = HTML content.

## Q&A

### Why is HTTP stateless? How do websites maintain sessions?

**HTTP is stateless** because:

- Each request/response is independent.
- Server doesn’t store any information about previous requests.

**Benefits:**

- Simplicity: server doesn’t need to remember clients.
- Scalability: easy to handle many clients without session memory

**Maintaining sessions:**

Websites need to **remember users** (login, cart, preferences). 

Common mechanisms:

1. **Cookies** – small data stored on client, sent with each request.
   - Example: `Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123`
2. **Session IDs on server** – server maps session_id → user data.
3. **Tokens (JWT)** – client stores token; server verifies it.

### Why HTTPS is critical for sensitive data (login, payment)?

HTTPS = HTTP + TLS/SSL → **encrypts communication**.

**Reasons it’s essential:**

- **Confidentiality:** prevents eavesdroppers from reading passwords, credit card info.
- **Integrity:** prevents tampering of data in transit.
- **Authentication:** server proves its identity (certificates) → prevents MITM attacks.

Without HTTPS, login credentials, payments, and personal data can be **intercepted** or **modified**.

### What is the difference between HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3?

| Feature                | HTTP/1.1                                | HTTP/2                                     | HTTP/3                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Transport**          | TCP                                     | TCP                                        | QUIC (UDP-based)                                             |
| **Multiplexing**       | No → 1 connection = 1 request at a time | Yes → multiple streams over one connection | Yes → multiple streams + 0-RTT connection                    |
| **Header compression** | No → repeated headers                   | Yes → HPACK                                | Yes → QPACK                                                  |
| **Latency**            | Higher due to multiple TCP connections  | Lower, pipelining & multiplexing           | Even lower, avoids TCP handshake/retransmit head-of-line blocking |
| **Security**           | Optional (TLS separately)               | Usually via TLS                            | Built-in (QUIC + TLS)                                        |

**0-RTT** (Zero Round-Trip Time) is a **feature of QUIC and TLS 1.3** that lets a client start sending data **immediately on a new connection** without waiting for a full handshake to complete.

HTTP/1.1 → simple, stateless, one request at a time → slower.

HTTP/2 → multiplexing, header compression → faster.

HTTP/3 → QUIC/UDP → avoids TCP head-of-line blocking, faster in lossy networks.

# DNS & Load Balancing

## Concept

### **DNS(Domain Name System)**

Translates **human-readable names** (e.g., `google.com`) → **IP addresses**.

Layers:

- browser → OS → ISP → recursive resolvers

Hierarchy:

- Root → TLD (`.com`, `.org`) → Authoritative server → Final record.

Common record types:

- `A` (IPv4), `AAAA` (IPv6), `CNAME`, `MX`, `NS`.

Caching is critical for **performance**.

### **Load Balancing**

Needed because one server **can’t handle millions of requests**.

Types:

- **DNS Round Robin**: multiple IPs returned in rotation.
- **Layer 4 (Transport-level)**: balance based on TCP/UDP.
- **Layer 7 (Application-level)**: balance based on HTTP headers, URL, cookies, etc.

Algorithms:

- Round Robin 

​		one by one.

- Least Connections

​		Server A has 50 active users, Server B has 20 → new request goes to Server B

- IP Hash (sticky sessions)

​		The client’s **IP address is hashed** to decide which server they go to.

## Q&A

### What happens when you type `www.google.com` into a browser?

DNS resolution(many layer) → TCP/QUIC/UDP connection → TLS Handshake → HTTP request → Server  response → Browser Rendering(show on screen).

### Why does DNS use caching at multiple layers (browser, OS, ISP)?

why multiple layers cache DNS?

Reduce Latency

Reduce Load on DNS Infrastructure

Handle Network Failures

Security & Control 

The Tradeoff → **TTL (Time To Live)**

- Every DNS record has a **TTL value** (e.g., 300s = 5 minutes).
- Too long TTL → changes (like new IP) propagate slowly.
- Too short TTL → less caching benefit, increase DNS traffic.

**all layers** (browser → OS → ISP → recursive resolvers) strikes a balance between **speed, scalability, and freshness**.

### What’s the trade-off between DNS load balancing vs L4/L7 load balancing?

**DNS Load Balancing** -- DNS server returns multiple IPs for the same domain

**Pros**:

- Simple — no extra infra needed besides DNS.
- Scales globally
- Works for all protocols

**Cons**:

- No visibility into server **health**
- **Slow reaction** → changes take time because of DNS TTL.
- Coarse-grained - once the client caches an IP, it won’t switch easily even if the server is overloaded.

**L4/L7 Load Balancing** -- A dedicated **load balancer** (software or hardware) sits in front of servers.

**L4**: Balances traffic at transport layer (TCP/UDP ports). Blind to app data.

**L7**: Balances at application layer (HTTP headers, cookies, gRPC, etc.).

**Pros**:

- **Fine-grained control**: Can do sticky sessions, SSL termination, header-based routing.
- **Health checks**: Can skip dead/slow servers immediately.
- **Fast reaction**: No DNS TTL delays.
- **Centralized policies** (rate limiting, security).

**Cons**:

- Extra **infrastructure & cost**.
- Can become a **bottleneck** or single point of failure if not scaled properly.
- Slightly more **latency** (one more hop).

**Real-world design**: Many large systems **combine both**:

- **DNS LB** → choose nearest region/datacenter.
- **L4/L7 LB** → balance across servers inside that region.

### How do CDNs (Cloudflare, Akamai) use DNS + load balancing to reduce latency?

#### **CDN Basics**

- CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) cache content (images, JS, videos) **closer to the user**, in edge servers distributed globally.
- Goal: reduce **latency** and **server load**.

#### DNS + Geo-Location

When you type `www.example.com`, your browser queries a **CDN-managed DNS**.

The CDN’s DNS returns an IP of an **edge server closest to you**

This is **DNS-based load balancing**, directing users to the optimal location **before traffic even starts**.

#### **L4/L7 Load Balancing at Edge**

- Each edge location has **multiple servers**.
- The CDN uses **L4/L7 load balancers** to:
  - Spread traffic evenly across the edge servers.
  - Handle health checks (skip overloaded/dead servers).
  - Optionally, apply sticky sessions or route by URL/cookies.

**Summary**:

User → DNS query → CDN DNS → nearest edge IP

Browser connects → L4/L7 load balancer at edge → one of the healthy edge servers

If content is cached → served immediately

If not cached → fetch from origin server, then cache it

**DNS** picks the **right region globally**.

**Load balancer** picks the **right server locally**.

Together → **fast, reliable, and scalable content delivery**.

# NAT, Firewall, and Security

## Conpect

### **NAT (Network Address Translation)**

- Translates **private IPs** (like `192.168.x.x`) → **public IPs** for Internet communication.
- Types:
  - **Static NAT**: one-to-one mapping.
  - **Dynamic NAT / PAT (Port Address Translation)**: many-to-one mapping using ports.
- **Pros**: Conserves IPv4 addresses, hides internal network structure.
- **Cons**: Breaks end-to-end connectivity, can complicate peer-to-peer apps.

### **Firewall**

- Controls network traffic based on rules (allow/deny).
- Types:
  - **Packet-filtering firewall** (L3/L4): check IP/port.
  - **Stateful firewall**: track connection states.
  - **Application firewall** (L7): filter by HTTP headers, URL, etc.
- Protects network from malicious traffic and enforces policies.

###  **Security Concepts**

- **Confidentiality**: data is only accessible to authorized users.
- **Integrity**: data cannot be tampered with undetected.
- **Availability**: services are up and reachable (protection against DDoS).
- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Auth: Verify identity.
  - Authz: Check permissions for actions/resources.
- **TLS/SSL**: encrypts traffic (HTTPS), protects against eavesdropping.
- **Intrusion Detection / Prevention**: monitors and blocks suspicious activities.

### How They Work Together

1. NAT hides internal IPs, enabling safe Internet access.
2. Firewall filters bad traffic, both inbound and outbound.
3. TLS + auth ensures secure communication between endpoints.

## Q&A

### Why does NAT break **incoming** connections?

NAT maps **outbound** connections, but without special rules, **inbound** unsolicited packets are dropped.

### What is the difference between NAT and a firewall?

| Feature     | NAT                                                | Firewall                                             |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Translate private ↔ public IPs                     | Control traffic, enforce security rules              |
| Layer       | L3/L4 (mostly)                                     | L3/L4 (packet) or L7 (application)                   |
| Main effect | Hides internal IPs, conserves addresses            | Blocks/permits traffic based on policy               |
| Example     | Home router mapping `192.168.1.5` → `203.0.113.10` | Block all incoming port 22 except SSH from office IP |

NAT is mainly about **address translation**, firewall is mainly about **traffic filtering**.

### How do PAT and port forwarding work?

**PAT (Port Address Translation):**

- Many private IPs share one public IP.
- Outbound connections are distinguished by **ports**.
- E.g., `192.168.1.2:5000` → `203.0.113.10:30000`, `192.168.1.3:5000` → `203.0.113.10:30001`.

**Port forwarding:**

- For **incoming connections**, the router/firewall forwards traffic on a specific port to a specific internal host.
- E.g., external `203.0.113.10:8080` → internal `192.168.1.5:80`.

### Why does NAT complicate peer-to-peer apps?

NAT breaks **end-to-end connectivity**: peers behind different NATs don’t know each other’s real IP/port.

Direct connection attempts fail unless you use **NAT traversal techniques** (STUN, TURN, UPnP).

### Explain stateful vs stateless firewalls.

| Type      | Description                                                  | Pros                                                | Cons                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Stateless | Filters packets individually based on rules (IP, port)       | Simple, fast                                        | Cannot track connection state |
| Stateful  | Tracks connection state (TCP handshake, established sessions) | Can allow return traffic automatically, more secure | Slightly more resource usage  |

### How would you secure a web server against attacks while keeping it reachable?

- **Network layer:**
  - Use firewall: allow ports 80/443, block all others.
  - Use NAT if behind private network.
- **Application layer:**
  - Use HTTPS (TLS).
  - Rate-limit requests to prevent DoS/DDoS attacks.
  - Keep software up to date.
- **Monitoring:**
  - IDS/IPS to detect attacks.
  - Logging & alerts.

# Socket Programming in Depth

## Concept

**What is a socket?**

- An abstraction that lets applications send/receive data across a network.
- Identified by: `(protocol, local IP, local port, remote IP, remote port)`.

**Types of sockets**

- **Stream sockets (SOCK_STREAM):** TCP, reliable, ordered, connection-oriented.
- **Datagram sockets (SOCK_DGRAM):** UDP, faster, connectionless, may drop packets.
- **Raw sockets:** direct access to IP packets (rare, often need root).

**Core system calls (TCP server example)**

- `socket()` → create a socket.
- `bind()` → assign local IP + port.
- `listen()` → put into passive (server) mode.
- `accept()` → accept new client connection (creates new socket).
- `connect()` → client side connects to server.
- `send()/recv()` or `write()/read()` → data transfer.
- `close()` → release socket.

**Blocking vs Non-blocking**

- **Blocking:** `recv()` waits until data arrives.
- **Non-blocking:** returns immediately (may need polling or `select()`/`epoll()`).

**Multiplexing**

- Handle many connections in one thread.
- APIs: `select()`, `poll()`, `epoll` (Linux), `kqueue` (BSD/macOS).

## Q&A

### Difference between blocking socket and non-blocking socket. 

- **Blocking socket** (default):
  - Calls like `recv()` or `accept()` **wait until the operation completes**.
  - Pros: simple to code.
  - Cons: one slow client can block the whole thread.
- **Non-blocking socket**:
  - Calls return **immediately** if there’s no data or connection.
  - Pros: you can handle multiple sockets in one thread.
  - Cons: code is more complex (need `select()`, `poll()`, or `epoll()`).

### Why do servers use `epoll` instead of one thread per connection? 

- Spawning a thread per connection uses a lot of **CPU & memory**.
- `epoll` (Linux) lets one thread **monitor thousands of sockets** efficiently:
  - Only wakes up when sockets are **ready for I/O**.
  - Reduces context switches and memory overhead.

This is all about **scalability** and **performance**.

### Explain the “C10K problem” (handling 10,000 connections). 

- Goal: handle **10,000 concurrent clients**.
- Problems with naive approach:
  - 10,000 threads = huge memory + CPU usage.
  - Context switches kill performance.
- Solution:
  - Use **non-blocking I/O + event-driven architecture** (`select`, `poll`, `epoll`).
  - Efficiently multiplex many connections in **a few threads**.

**TL;DR:** “C10K problem” = scaling servers to handle 10k+ simultaneous clients efficiently.

### How TCP socket states (LISTEN, ESTABLISHED, TIME_WAIT, CLOSE_WAIT) matter.

| State                       | Meaning                                           | Why it matters                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **LISTEN**                  | Server socket waiting for new connections         | Only listens; cannot send/recv data                          |
| **SYN_SENT / SYN_RECEIVED** | Connection handshake in progress                  | Ensures both sides agree to communicate                      |
| **ESTABLISHED**             | Connection ready for data transfer                | Normal sending/receiving occurs here                         |
| **FIN_WAIT1 / FIN_WAIT2**   | Connection is closing (initiated by you)          | Ensures all data is sent before closing                      |
| **TIME_WAIT**               | Wait to ensure remote received FIN                | Prevents delayed packets from interfering with new connections |
| **CLOSE_WAIT**              | Remote closed connection, waiting for local close | Server must close to fully release resources                 |

# CDN & Caching

## Concept

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)

A **CDN** is a network of distributed servers that cache and deliver content (HTML, images, video, JS, CSS) **closer to users**.

**Why CDNs?**

- Reduce **latency** (shorter physical distance).
- Reduce **server load** (traffic handled by CDN edge nodes).
- Increase **reliability** (CDN can reroute if one server fails).
- Handle **traffic spikes** (e.g., Black Friday, live streaming).

👉 Examples: **Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront, Fastly**.

### Caching Basics

Caching = storing frequently used data in a **faster location**.

**Levels of Caching**

1. **Browser cache** – stored on user’s machine (static files: JS, CSS).
2. **CDN cache** – stored at edge servers close to the user.
3. **Server cache** – in reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Varnish).
4. **Application cache** – in RAM (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
5. **Database cache** – query results cached to avoid repeated DB hits.

###  Cache Control in HTTP

HTTP headers let you control caching:

- **Cache-Control: max-age=3600** → valid for 1 hour.
- **ETag** → identifier for resource version.
- **Last-Modified** → helps with validation.

### Trade-offs

- ✅ Faster response, lower bandwidth.
- ❌ Risk of **stale data** (must handle invalidation carefully).
- ❌ Complexity: cache invalidation is “one of the two hardest problems in CS”

## Q&A

### Why do companies use a CDN instead of just scaling up their origin servers?

CDNs reduce latency by serving from edge servers closer to users, offload traffic from origin, provide redundancy, and handle traffic spikes better than a single centralized server.

### How does a CDN know which server should serve a user request?

CDNs use DNS-based load balancing and Anycast routing to direct users to the nearest/least loaded edge node.

### What challenges do CDNs face with dynamic content?

 Dynamic data (e.g., personalized feeds, stock prices) can’t be cached easily. Solutions: edge computing, API caching with short TTL, or cache invalidation on updates.

### What are the trade-offs of caching?

- ✅ Pros: faster response, reduced backend load, cost savings.
- ❌ Cons: stale data risk, cache invalidation complexity, memory usage.

### How do you decide **what to cache**?

- Cache **static content** (CSS, JS, images).
- Cache expensive DB queries or API responses.
- Don’t cache **sensitive data** (passwords, per-user tokens).

### Explain cache eviction policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO). Which one would you use?

- **LRU (Least Recently Used):** evicts items not used recently → good balance.
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used):** evicts items used least often → good if popularity is stable.
- **FIFO:** simple, but may evict hot items.
- Most systems use **LRU** or **LFU** (e.g., Redis supports both).
